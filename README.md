# Apache Hive
Hackolade plugin for Apache Hive

Hackolade exposes its core data modeling engine through a plugin architecture.  Each plugin applies the Hackolade data modeling capabilities to a specific target technology, whether for data-at-rest (databases) or data-in-motion (communications.)  Each plugin matches the specific aspects of the target in terms of terminology, storage model, data types, and communication protocol.

To enable data modeling capabilities for a target, you must first download and install the plugin, following these [instructions](https://hackolade.com/help/DownloadadditionalDBtargetplugin.htm "Plugin download instructions").

Plugins can be customized by following these [instructions](https://hackolade.com/help/Userdefinedcustomproperties.html "Plugin customization instructions").
